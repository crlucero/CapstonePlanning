## Description
My idea for this project is to create somewhat of an e-commerce website. I would like to build a site that revolves around sneakers. I haven't had any luck in finding a database with a high quantity of shoes, so I will initially have a component that stores all the sneaker information. I plan on starting out with hard coding about 50 items. 

### Features
- Landing page will show trending shoes (pictures, price, description.?)
- User can search for a shoe
- User can see price of shoe
- User can click on picture of shoe and get shoe details
- User can login and add desired shoes to a 'want' list
- User can add shoes to cart and get estimated price (Without actually being able to buy, obviously.)
